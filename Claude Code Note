Note on Claude Code Link:
I completed the assignment using Claude Code (Anthropic). Since I am on the basic/free plan, the platform does not allow creating a public/shareable project link. All project files, including the master table, prompts, and code used for vendor classification and strategic recommendations, have been uploaded to this GitHub repository for review.
Please let me know if you need any additional files or outputs from Claude Code, and I can provide them directly.
